# Shimmie

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DakuTree/shimmie2.svg?branch=FTAG)](https://travis-ci.org/DakuTree/shimmie2)

This is the custom/personal branch of Shimmie.

It changes a bunch of things which allow Shimmie, when used with a bunch of other scripts, to be used as something that can be used for personal manga/comic management.

This branch is only here as an example of how this can be done, and isn't really meant to be used by someone other than myself.
If you are however, curious on how to get this thing working, hit my email @ <mailto:admin+ftag@codeanimu.net>

(If you somehow got here by accident, and are looking for the official shimmie repo, please check shish/shimmie2)

If you give shimmie to someone else, you have to give them the source (which should be easy, as PHP
is an interpreted language...). If you want to add customisations to your own
site, then those customisations belong to you, and you can do what you want
with them.
